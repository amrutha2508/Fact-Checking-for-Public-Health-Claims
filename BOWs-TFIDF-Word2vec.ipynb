It also asked for privacy. The statement was posted on the Pat Summitt Foundation\\u2019s website and was issued by Erin Freeman, a spokeswoman for the Summitt family. Former Tennessee player Tamika Catchings was flying to Knoxville to visit the coach instead of returning to Indiana with the WNBA\\u2019s Fever. Other former players were issuing support on Twitter through the \\u201cPrayForPat\\u201d hashtag. Phoenix Mercury center and Tennessee alum Isabelle Harrison said former Lady Volunteers players were keeping up with Summitt\\u2019s situation in a group text-message chain. \\u201cThere are like 30 of us in a group chat right now talking, and people are flying into Knoxville and trying to see her,\\u201d Harrison said Sunday after the Mercury\\u2019s victory over the New York Liberty. \\u201cYou just didn\\u2019t expect any of this to happen. Everyone\\u2019s trying to fill each other in with any information they have.\\u201d Harrison said she often went to Summitt\\u2019s home and rehabbed with her last year while recovering from a torn anterior cruciate ligament that ended the post player\\u2019s senior season at Tennessee prematurely. They also occasionally went to practice together. \\u201cI was at practice one day watching some of the girls, (and a) freshman took a fast shot,\\u201d Harrison said. \\u201d(Summitt) looked at me and was like, \\u2018What was wrong was that?\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018She shot too quick.\\u2019 (She said), \\u2018Yeah, that\\u2019s right.\\u2019 (Summitt) still had it.\\u201d The update about Summitt\\u2019s condition brought a flood of support from throughout the sports world. An outpouring of concern on social media came from rival coaches such as South Carolina\\u2019s Dawn Staley, Notre Dame\\u2019s Muffet McGraw and Vanderbilt\\u2019s Stephanie White. Other sympathetic tweets came from sports figures as varied as Billie Jean King and Steve Spurrier. Summitt stepped down as Tennessee\\u2019s coach in 2012, one year after announcing her diagnosis of early onset dementia, Alzheimer\\u2019s type. She went 1,098-208 with eight national titles. She has the most career wins of any Division I men\\u2019s or women\\u2019s basketball coach. Since her diagnosis, Summitt has played a leading role in the fight against Alzheimer\\u2019s. She launched the Pat Summitt Foundation, which is dedicated to researching and educating people about the disease while also providing services to patients and caregivers. The Pat Summitt Alzheimer\\u2019s Clinic is scheduled to open at the University of Tennessee medical center in December. \\u201cWhen she fights this disease, what she has taught all of us is how to do it with courage,\\u201d former Tennessee women\\u2019s athletic director Joan Cronan said at a 2015 charity event honoring Summitt. \\u201cShe\\u2019s done that from Day One. It\\u2019s been about (how) we can find a cure for this disease, and she has done it facing it straight-on and she\\u2019s done it giving back as she always has.\\u201d Summitt continues to hold a position as head coach emeritus of the Tennessee women\\u2019s basketball team. She attended nearly every home game and many practices in the first year after stepped down as coach, though she had a less visible role in subsequent seasons. She cut back on public appearances in recent years. --- AP Basketball Writer Doug Feinberg in New York contributed to this report.\",\n          \"\\\"It\\u2019s the question-du-jour about the new health care law: Are people going to be able to keep their health insurance if they like it? President Barack Obama has several times said yes. But cancellation notices coming in the mail to policyholders tell another story. The contrast between Obama\\u2019s promises and what\\u2019s playing out in America has led to a fierce political war of words about who lied, who knew what and when, and how Americans will have to deal with the ramifications. Former Obama campaign strategist David Axelrod and Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn debated the issue Monday on MSNBC\\u2019s Morning Joe. Coburn: \\\"\\\"You're no longer eligible to buy your own plan, which was the No. 1 promise that the president made to the American people. You cannot get what you had.\\\"\\\" Axelrod: \\\"\\\"Most people are going to keep their own plans, senator, and you know that.\\\"\\\" Coburn: \\\"\\\"That\\u2019s not true.\\\"\\\" Moments later, Axelrod made his point again: \\\"\\\"The majority of people in this country, the vast majority of people in this country, are keeping their plan. People who are uninsured are going to have choices they never had before.\\\"\\\" In this fact-check, we wanted to dig into what\\u2019s happening to the American health insurance system to see what policies are being canceled, how many, why and how you might be affected. A good starting point is to see how Americans get their insurance right now. Using census data, the Kaiser Family Foundation finds that in 2012, a little less than 50 percent of the public got their coverage through an employer-based plan. That is, a business negotiates a contract with an insurance company and offers health coverage to its workers. The second largest group, about 30 percent, gets insurance through either Medicare, Medicaid or both. A third group of people with insurance, about 6 percent, buy policies directly from insurance companies. This is called the individual market. (The remainder of Americans, around 16 percent, are currently uninsured.) The health care law that was passed in 2010 made changes to all three legs of the health insurance stool, but the biggest changes came in the individual market. Before the health care law was passed, the individual market was widely considered a mess. Insurers could turn you down for pre-existing conditions, and none of the insurance was standardized, so if you bought a policy, it wasn\\u2019t always crystal clear what you were getting. The law\\u2019s goal always had been to get these people into standardized plans that cover a defined list of benefits. As a result, some existing policies did not meet standards set by the new health care law. This is why people in this group may be seeing cancellation notices. Kaiser estimates that 15 million people are in the individual market. They are likely to have a very different experience from the \\\"\\\"vast majority\\\"\\\" cited by Axelrod. In New Jersey and Florida, hundreds of thousands of people have received cancellation notices and more are popping up across the country. It\\u2019s unclear how many people in the individual market will be forced to change their plan. And what happens to people who are will vary. People can buy another plan from the same company or shop around. Some of them will be eligible for government subsidies and some will not. This group is where the disruptions are most likely. Another group of people -- about 90 million -- are covered through through Medicare or Medicaid. While the Affordable Care Act does make changes, most notably in something called the Medicare Advantage program, they are not being moved into new coverage plans. That leaves the nearly 150 million people who get their insurance through the plans their employer offer. Those plans could change. But it\\u2019s tough to say how substantially, and how much as a result of the health care law. Part of that is because plans change every year. Still, some companies are making changes to bring costs down. For example, UPS is telling their employees that if their spouse can receive health insurance through a different employer, UPS will no longer offer them coverage. That certainly could mean people are not keeping their health care plan. How much of the blame should be shouldered by the health care law is a different matter. We asked a variety of experts to comment on the literal accuracy of Axelrod\\u2019s statement. For the most part, regardless of their opinion of the new health care law, they gave Axelrod the benefit of the doubt. \\\"\\\"It\\u2019s probably true -- at least for next year,\\\"\\\" said Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H. W. Bush. \\\"\\\"Most employers aren\\u2019t going to do anything about the insurance they are offering for 2014 because of the Affordable Care Act.\\\"\\\" \\\"\\\"He is absolutely right,\\\"\\\" said Bob Laszewski, a health insurance consultant and head of Health Policy and Strategy Associates. But Laszweski also said Axelrod was intentionally diverting attention from the real problems taking place in the individual market. Gerard Anderson, director of the Center for Hospital Finance and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said, \\\"\\\"I would make the same comment that David Axelrod makes but without any real facts. The people with large employers are not really being impacted by the (health care law) and neither are the Medicare and Medicaid recipients.\\\"\\\" Sabrina Corlette, program director at at Georgetown University\\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, echoed Anderson\\u2019s point. For Ted Marmor, a professor of health policy at Yale University, rejected Axelrod\\u2019s claim, largely because no one has the hard evidence to back it up or refute it. \\\"\\\"No one has the data to be sure,\\\"\\\" Marmor said. \\\"\\\"Axelrod has no authority for his claim. It is a hope.\\\"\\\" But Marmor is among the minority of the experts we consulted. \\\"\\\"It's simply true,\\\"\\\" said Dan Mendelson, CEO of Avalere Health, a Washington health consulting group. \\\"\\\"Most of the lives are in the large corporate customer base and we're seeing virtually no dropping of coverage there.\\\"\\\" What does it mean to keep your plan? In the view of some analysts, if the plan offered by an employer changes, it is not the same plan and this would make Axelrod wrong. Chris Conover, a critic of Obamacare and an adjunct scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, said the Affordable Care Act requires that every plan offer certain minimum benefits, such as free preventive care. It also allows children up to age 26 to stay on their parents\\u2019 plan. Those and other rules drive up premiums and lead to employers offering different plans. Conover said millions of people \\\"\\\"actually have had to purchase more expensive coverage even if they were perfectly happy with their old coverage.\\\"\\\" Axelrod\\u2019s office takes a different view. We contacted them and his staff pointed us to a 2013 survey by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans. Based on responses from 966 organizations, including firms both small and large, the survey found that 94 percent were definitely or very likely to continue to offer coverage. In that sense, the majority of Americans would still get insurance through their employer. Still, in the survey, about half of the companies estimated Obamacare would raise costs in the range of 1 to 4 percent. Many businesses, in the range of 30 to 40 percent overall, planned to increase the employee share of premiums, raise their deductibles and in other ways shift costs to workers. But it is important to remember that cost and risk shifting has been with the country for a long time. The Kaiser Family Foundation annual survey of employer plans reports that in the past 10 years, the average share of premiums paid by employees has gone up and the fraction of workers in high-deductible plans has risen steadily since 2006, reaching one fifth of the people in the study in 2013. Richard Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America\\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group of insurance companies, said the impact of the health care law takes place within an insurance marketplace that has been far from static. \\\"\\\"There have been year to year changes to policies,\\\"\\\" Zirkelbach said. Of all the factors that drive those changes -- rising medical costs, changes in the health of the people in the insurance pool, and government regulation -- Zirkelbach believes the Affordable Care Act rules are having the largest impact as employers look to 2014. Zirkelbach points especially to the minimum requirements for every insurance plan. The employee benefit survey reports that about three quarters of all plans meet all minimum requirements and need no further changes. Our ruling Axelrod said the vast majority of people are keeping their health care plans. That\\u2019s certainly what the 2010 health care law intended. The law was crafted largely to leave in place the health care delivery systems for people who get health insurance either through their employer (about 50 percent of people with insurance) or through the government-managed Medicare or Medicaid programs (about 30 percent). Some changes may be occurring in the employer market that would stop people from keeping the health care plans they have. But the bigger issues are in the so-called individual market, which accounts for about 6 percent of Americans who now have health care. The health care law, in essence, raises standards that will make many plans offered in the individual market obsolete. Experts told us there is no precise data to determine how many people will be forced to change health care plans, but they generally agreed the number will be small this year. The broad consensus is that, for the time being, most people will see changes in their coverage and what they pay for that coverage consistent with changes they have seen with their insurance over the past decade.\\\"\",\n          \"Republican Gov. Charlie Baker administered oaths to the 40-member Senate and 160-member House in ceremonies signaling the start of the 191st term for one of America\\u2019s oldest legislative bodies. Formally known as the General Court, the Legislature traces its roots to the Colonial era. The first order of business in each chamber \\u2014 both firmly controlled by Democrats \\u2014 was the re-election of presiding officers. Rep. Robert DeLeo, of Winthrop, already the longest-serving House speaker in the state\\u2019s history having first taken the gavel in 2009, returned for another two-year term. Ashland Democrat Karen Spilka will serve her first full term as Senate president after first assuming the post in July. Speaking in the ornate Senate chamber, which reopened Wednesday for the first time in more than 18 months following a $20 million renovation, Spilka called for several \\u201cbold\\u201d initiatives in response to what she said were demands from Massachusetts residents to move beyond \\u201csmall ideas and incremental change.\\u201d Spilka said her priorities would include legislation to better control health care spending by reining in the high cost of prescription drugs and redistribute state education funding to better serve children who live in poorer school districts. Recalling the untreated psychological trauma her father suffered as a result of his military service, the Senate leader also appealed for a broad expansion of mental health services throughout the state. \\u201cWe simply cannot end the epidemic of addiction or solve the problems of chronic homelessness and unemployment, child abuse and neglect, veteran and first responder PTSD, childhood bullying, or repeated incarceration, without first addressing the underlying issue of mental health,\\u201d said Spilka. While not specifically calling for tax increases, Spilka said the state would need to \\u201ccapture new revenues\\u201d to support new and existing programs. Spilka, a liberal Democrat, was widely expected to stake out a progressive agenda that could meet resistance in the House, which is also controlled by Democrats but is seen as more conservative than the Senate. Baker, a moderate Republican who remains opposed to any broad-based tax hikes, could also prove a stumbling block. In brief comments following his re-election on Wednesday, DeLeo declared that \\u201cno one\\u2019s rights will be infringed upon in Massachusetts,\\u201d an apparent swipe at the policies of President Donald Trump and other Republicans in Washington. DeLeo generally waits until a few weeks into a new session before outlining his legislative priorities. Sen. Bruce Tarr, of Gloucester, and Rep. Brad Jones, of North Reading, will again serve as the minority leaders in their respective chambers. There are 32 Republicans in the House and only six in the Senate, with the GOP having lost a handful of legislative seats in the November election.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

India’s ministry of health has advised that the anti-HIV drugs, Lopinavir and Retonovir, are used in some groups of Covid-19 patients. But it is unclear how successful this treatment has been. The other two drugs from the claim are not mentioned in their guidance. Researchers at the Erasmus Medical Center claim to have found an antibody against coronavirus. Researchers in the Netherlands have released research, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, on an antibody against the new coronavirus. A 103 year-old Chinese grandmother has made a full recovery from Covid-19 after being treated for 6 days in Wuhan, China This has been widely reported in the media. Apple has reopened all 42 China stores. Correct. On 13 March 2020, Apple announced that it had reopened all 42 stores in mainland China after a closure of almost six weeks. Cleveland Clinic developed a Covid-19 test that gives results in hours, not days. The number of new cases in South Korea is declining.

Scientists in Israel are likely to announce the development of a coronavirus vaccine. Scientists in Israel and elsewhere are working on developing a vaccination to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, but it won’t be ready for the public for over a year. Three Maryland coronavirus patients fully recovered and are able to return to everyday life. Correct. On 13 March 2020, Montgomery County, Maryland confirmed that three residents who previously had the virus no longer tested positive. A network of Canadian scientists are making excellent progress in Covid-19 research. At least one group of Canadian scientists has recently announced some progress in understanding Covid-19. A San Diego biotech company is developing a Covid-19 vaccine in collaboration with Duke University and National University of Singapore. Tulsa County's first positive Covid-19 case has recovered. This individual has had two negative tests, which is the indicator of recovery. Correct, this patient has recovered according to official Tulsa County sources. Two negative tests is one of three official indicators of recovery among people with Covid-19 (who showed symptoms). All seven patients who were getting treated for Covid-19 at Safdarjung hospital in New Delhi have recovered. There is a news story reporting that seven patients in this hospital in New Delhi had recovered. However, these were not the only Covid-19 patients in the city.

In 2011/12, 120 patients in England waited 12 hours between the decision to admit them to emergency admissions and their actual admission, compared to 3,500 in 2017/18. Spending on social care is down 8% since 2010. Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies last year said that between 2009/10 and 2016/17, councils’ spending on adult social care in England fell 8% in real terms. Newer analysis says that it fell by 6% over the same period. We’ve asked it for more information. There are 5,240 fewer mental health nurses since 2010.

It then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and the lungs, causing pneumonia, which takes about 5 or 6 days. With pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty breathing. The nasal congestion makes you feel like you’re drowning. This is a roughly accurate description of the most common symptoms, although not everyone with Covid-19 gets pneumonia.

Italy has found that Covid-19 is actually disseminated intravascular coagulation (thrombosis). The way to cure this is antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants. Antibiotics do not directly treat Covid-19, which is caused by a virus. The anti-inflammatory ibuprofen is being trialled for use against Covid-19 and an anticoagulant has been used in some Covid-19 cases. Aspirin is not a specific cure. Covid-19 is not a virus, but a bacterium being amplified by 5G which causes inflammation and hypoxia. Covid-19 patients can get secondary infections from bacteria. Hypoxia and types of inflammation can be symptoms of Covid-19. There’s no proof Covid-19 is in any way related to 5G. People with Covid-19 should take aspirin 100mg and Apronax or paracetamol. Trials into both of these drugs’ effectiveness in treating Covid-19 are ongoing, but haven’t concluded yet. Paracetamol can ease symptoms but isn’t a specific treatment. Covid-19 clots the blood causing thrombosis, stopping blood flow and oxygenating the heart and lungs. Severe Covid-19 can cause blood clotting problems and issues like this have been seen in Covid-19 patients, but this is not the only thing that can be fatal in patients.

The Italian Medicines Agency doesn’t mention aspirin or apronax in its list drugs used to treat Covid-19 outside of clinical trials.

Trump tweeted the first statement on March 9: The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, “The risk is low to the average American.” — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 9, 2020  The latter was a statement Trump made during a Coronavirus Task Force press briefing from the White House on March 17. As can be seen in the following video (at the 1:05:00 mark), as Trump fielded a question from a reporter about whether his “tone” on the pandemic had suddenly changed the previous day, he declared, “This is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. All you had to do is look at other countries; I think now it’s in almost 120 countries all over the world. No, I’ve always viewed it as very serious. There was no difference yesterday from days before”: The New York Times chronicled this statement from Trump and contrasted it with others he had made in the weeks leading up to it: For weeks, President Trump has minimized the coronavirus, mocked concern about it and treated the risk from it cavalierly. On [March 17] he took to the White House lectern and made a remarkable assertion: He knew it was a pandemic all along. “This is a pandemic,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.” This is what Mr. Trump has actually said over the past two months: On Jan. 22, asked by a CNBC reporter whether there were “worries about a pandemic,” the president replied: “No, not at all.

Although some commenters disclaimed the above-displayed photographs as depicting an aerodynamically impossible activity, according to Kevin McGowan, a biologist who specializes in crow behavior, they are indeed real: “This would be kind of like a dog chasing a car and jumping up” on it, says McGowan. “Dogs always want to catch the car, but they never know what they’d do if they get it.” But why didn’t the eagle react to the crow landing? Since the crow wasn’t pecking, it didn’t warrant the Eagle’s attention. As the largest bird of prey, eagles are harassed nonstop by birds of all species. Sometimes the hecklers are so persistent, it looks like the eagles “are being followed by mosquitoes,” says McGowan. Phoo Chan, the bird photographer who snapped the photographs back in May 2014, offered a similar explanation on his 500px page: Crows are known for aggressively harassing other raptors that are much bigger in size when spotted in their territories and usually these ‘intruders’ simply retreat without much fuss. However, in this frame the crow did not seem to harass the bald eagle at such close proximity and neither did the bald eagle seem to mind the crow’s presence invading its personal space. What made it even more bizarre was that the crow even made a brief stop on the back of the eagle as if it was taking a free scenic ride and the eagle simply obliged. Chan’s photographs may seemingly depict an impossible (or at least one-in-a-million) scene, but other images of crows “riding” eagles abound online. In 2012, for example, Caters News photographer Hyeongchol Kim captured a similar occurrence in South Korea:   I saw the crow flying towards the much bigger eagle, and prepared myself to capture the fight on camera. However, the bird just hovered above the eagle for a few seconds – and then appeared to just latch onto his back.

The method used to identify the new biomarkers is described as “a specialized technique developed at McMaster [University]” (where the research was done), making it difficult or impossible to estimate what the cost may be. The benefit here would appear to be that diagnostic testing for CF would be better able to identify infants who have CF, and possibly understand more about the expected course for individual patients — particularly patients with borderline results on the sweat chloride test currently used to diagnose CF in newborns. However, it’s not clear how common these cases are. Are there a lot of patients who have borderline sweat chloride tests? In addition, the release doesn’t tell us how much better the new biomarkers are at diagnosing CF. It suggests that the new tests add accuracy to the diagnosis — but by how much? The potential harms here involve errors in diagnosis. More specifically, the story does not address the specificity or sensitivity of the biomarker testing. And this is important. Specificity indicates how good a test is at ruling out people who don’t have a problem. Sensitivity addresses how good a test is at positively identifying people who actually have the problem. False positives can result in unnecessary treatments and costs. False negatives can result in patients not getting treatments that could help them. And if it’s still too early to tell what the specificity or sensitivity of the tests are, they need to address that. The release does not tell readers how many patients were involved in the study, making it impossible to tell how robust these findings are. In this case, the relevant journal article tells us that there were 50 infants who were not affected by CF and 18 that were affected by CF. For most conditions, this would be considered a very small sample size. It’s not clear whether consideration needs to be given to the fact that CF is a relatively uncommon disorder, making it more difficult to garner a larger sample size. The release would have been stronger if it had addressed this. No disease mongering here. The funding source is clearly marked and there does not appear to be a conflict of interest. However, it’s not clear whether the “specialized technique developed at McMaster” is being patented for use in the marketplace, or if it is being made freely available to other researchers. Either way, that would be a valuable point to make in the release. The release does a good job of explaining the sweat chloride test, which is widely used to make a final diagnosis of CF in infants and children. It is not clear how far these research findings are from making their way into clinical use. The story does a good job of explaining what is new here — researchers have found specific chemicals in the sweat of infants with CF that appear to be related to the disease. The release only stumbles when presenting what these findings mean or how they may be used in the context of clinical diagnosis and care. Here’s the news release headline: “Scientists discover biomarkers which could lead to better treatments for CF patients” (emphasis added). Treatments are mentioned only twice in the text of the release. Here, in the second paragraph: “The findings…shed new light on the underlying mechanisms of CF and could lead to improved prognosis and better therapies for a disease which is quite variable, affecting different children in different ways, say researchers.” And here, in the ninth paragraph: “The biomarkers also point to other underlying mechanisms that contribute to the progression of CF and could lead to better therapeutic interventions earlier in life.” In short, the release offers very little to support the idea of better treatments for CF patients. How does the study improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of CF? And how could that potentially lead to improved treatments? The release doesn’t tell us. One could see how it may lead to earlier treatment, if diagnoses are improved, but the release doesn’t address how earlier treatment could improve patient outcomes. So, while one can say that these biomarkers “could” lead to better treatments, one could just as easily say that these biomarkers “may not” lead to better treatments. The release would have been on much firmer ground if it had either fleshed out how the findings may inform future treatment research or had focused on the value of the study’s findings in regard to diagnostics.</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>\"Sen. Chris Dodd has been  widely panned  as the man responsible for allowing bailout recipient AIG to hand out huge bonuses, but it's really a  half truth  to say he's to blame. Dodd was actually the author of a provision that  limited  bonuses for AIG and other financial companies, though it's true that he later added a loophole that allowed some bonuses. Nevertheless, in the course of explaining his role in the matter, Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, committed one of this year’s most conspicuous flip-flops. As keepers of the Flip-O-Meter, we feel obligated to document it. Here’s what happened: As word of AIG’s bonuses filtered out, critics zeroed in on an amendment Congress passed in February that outlawed such bonuses but exempted contracts signed before Feb. 11, 2009. The amendment prohibited firms that had received federal bailout money from \"\"paying or accruing any bonus\"\" to the 25 most highly compensated employees as long as the company still owed the government money for the bailout. But somewhere in the legislative process, a line was added to say the amendment \"\"shall not be construed to prohibit any bonus payment required to be paid pursuant to a written employment contract executed on or before February 11, 2009.\"\" The extra line allowed AIG to hand out $165 million in bonuses for 2008 to executives of a division that lost piles of money that year. Dodd had authored the original amendment. So CNN asked him on March 18 whether he was the one who added the Feb. 11 effective date. \"\"There is the suggestion today being made that you received more money from AIG than any other senator, and that you were responsible for the February 11th, 2009, date,\"\" CNN producer Ted Barrett said to Dodd on March 18. \"\"So, just — you know, again, I just want to get at ...\"\" \"\"No,\"\" Dodd said. \"\"You're saying you had nothing to do with that date?\"\" Barrett pressed. \"\"Absolutely not,\"\" Dodd said. That was pretty clear. And yet a day later, with other sources telling CNN that Dodd was in fact the one who made the change, Dodd admitted as much. \"\"I agreed to a modification in the legislation, reluctantly,\"\" he told CNN's Dana Bash. \"\"I wasn't negotiating with myself here. I wasn't changing my own amendment. I was changing the amendment because others were insisting upon it.\"\" \"\"You were very adamant yesterday, very adamant that you didn't know how this change got in there,\"\" Bash said. \"\"And now you are saying that your staff did work with the administration?\"\" \"\"Going back and looking — obviously, I apologize,\"\" Dodd said. Treasury officials later confirmed they had asked Dodd to change the amendment because they were afraid executives would sue if it was retroactive. In a  press conference  , Dodd stressed that he was the one who authored the bonus restrictions in the first place, and that Treasury requested the change. \"\"I'm angry about it, and angry that in a sense I've been held up as sort of responsible for all this when in fact I responded to what I thought was a reasonable request at the time,\"\" Dodd said. \"\"I went through six weeks of a lot of criticism from the financial press, from Wall Street and others that my amendment was too restrictive, that it was unfair, that there would be a brain drain, that people would leave right and left.\"\" Still, it was Dodd who chose to insert the loophole.

This is in the right ballpark, but it doesn’t seem to be the best comparison. It seems to compare the number of beds at different times of the year, but the number available fluctuates seasonally. Comparing July-September in 2010 and 2017, the decrease in beds available overnight in England is closer to 13,200. 66 A&E and maternity wards have been closed. We don’t know, as this information isn’t collected nationally. In 2014, there were reportedly plans to close or downgrade 66 in England, but while some have been, others have stayed open. 103 NHS walk-in centres have closed or been downgraded since 2010. We don’t know exactly, as this information isn’t collected centrally. Research from an NHS regulator and from campaign group 38 Degrees suggests more than 90 have been closed or downgraded. 60 ambulance stations have closed since 2010. We don’t know how many ambulance stations have closed since 2010 as national figures on this aren’t regularly published. 1,000 GP practices have closed since 2010. There are around 1,000 fewer GP practices in England in 2017 than in 2010. Some practices may have merged together, rather than closing completely, but we don’t know how many have done so. A&E four hour targets have been missed more than 10 million times since 2010. Correct. Between 2010/11 and 2017/18, around 12 million A&E attendances in England took over four hours from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge. The number of patients waiting more than 12 hours in A&E is up 2,700% since 2010. Correct (although not all patients will necessarily have been waiting in A&E). In 2011/12, 120 patients in England waited 12 hours between the decision to admit them to emergency admissions and their actual admission, compared to 3,500 in 2017/18. Spending on social care is down 8% since 2010. Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies last year said that between 2009/10 and 2016/17, councils’ spending on adult social care in England fell 8% in real terms. Newer analysis says that it fell by 6% over the same period. We’ve asked it for more information. There are 5,240 fewer mental health nurses since 2010. This seems to be looking at different months in 2010 and 2017, which isn’t the best comparison. Comparing the number of full-time equivalent mental health nurses between January 2010 and January 2018 (the latest figures), the drop is closer to 4,500. The number of operations classed as urgent that have been cancelled twice have doubled since 2010. Correct. The number of urgent operations in England cancelled for the second time or more for non-medical reasons more than doubled between 2011/12 and 2017/18. There has been a 22% drop in ambulances meeting their 15 minute transfer target since 2010. The decrease is actually greater—28%. In 2010/11 in England 80% of ambulance transfers were done in 15 minutes, in 2015/16 it was 58%.

It may be present in trace amounts of some vaccines. It is potentially carcinogenic, but only in much larger amounts than would be in a vaccine. The antibiotics gentamicin sulfate and polymyxin b are in vaccines and can cause allergic reactions ranging from mild to life-threatening. Traces of these antibiotics can end up in certain vaccines, but would only cause a reaction in someone severely allergic. Genetically modified yeast, animal, bacterial and viral DNA in vaccines can be incorporated into the recipient’s DNA causing unknown genetic mutations. Modified DNA can be used in the production of some vaccines, but is very unlikely to end up in the final product. Even if it did, there’s no evidence it can cause mutations. Glutaraldehyde is in vaccines and is poisonous if ingested and causes birth defects in animals. There are trace amounts in some vaccines from manufacturing, and not enough to cause harm. Formaldehyde is in vaccines and causes cancer in humans among other issues and is banned from vaccines in most European countries. It’s not banned in Europe. There are only trace amounts in certain vaccines and not enough to be carcinogenic. Latex rubber is in vaccines and causes life-threatening allergic reactions. Latex is used in the packaging of some vaccines, which could potentially cause harm if someone’s strongly allergic to it. Human and animal cells from sources like aborted foetuses are in vaccines and are linked to childhood leukaemia and diabetes. They may be used in certain vaccines’ production, but are unlikely to make it to the final product. Mercury (aka thimerosal or thiomersal) is in vaccines and can damage brain, gut, liver, bone marrow, nervous system and kidneys, is linked to autoimmune disorder, autism. Thiomersal isn’t in any UK vaccines any more. This is down to concern around a slightly different mercury-based chemical. MSG is in vaccines and is linked to birth defects, developmental delays, infertility and is banned in Europe. It’s not banned in Europe. It’s used in some vaccines to stabilise them. There’s no strong evidence it causes these problems in humans. Neomycin sulphate, an antibiotic, is in vaccines and can lead to epilepsy, brain damage and allergic reactions. Trace amounts of this antibiotic may end up in certain vaccines. If you are allergic to it could cause an allergic reaction. Phenol / phenoxyethanol is in vaccines and is used as antifreeze. It is toxic to all cells and can destroy the immune system. These chemicals have been used in vaccines as preservatives. They are not in antifreeze. Polysorbate 80 and 20 are in vaccines and cause cancer in animals and are linked to autoimmune issues and infertility. Tiny amounts of Polysorbate 80 is in a type of flu vaccine. There isn’t evidence ingesting it is linked to these issues in humans. Tri(n) butylphosphate is in vaccines and is potentially damaging to the kidneys and the nervous system. We can find no evidence of this being used in vaccines in the UK.

These are the symptoms for the common cold, but they don’t rule out Covid-19. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose. Some Covid-19 patients do get pneumonia, and one of the symptoms is a dry cough. A runny nose doesn’t rule out Covid-19. The new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of 26/27 degrees. It hates the Sun. There’s no evidence for this. There’s evidence that similar viruses transmit less well in the heat, but many countries with reported Covid-19 cases are experiencing temperatures higher than this. If someone with the new coronavirus sneezes, it travels about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne. Environmental factors impact how far droplets from a sneeze can travel, but it is likely to be several metres. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into contact with any metal surface - wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap. It’s not yet known exactly how long the virus survives on surfaces. It can survive for 6-12 hours on fabric and will be killed by normal laundry detergent . There’s no evidence the virus can survive in clothing and be transmitted this way. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice. There’s no evidence that the temperature of liquids consumed can protect you from viruses. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes. There is no evidence yet on how long the virus can survive on the skin. But it is important to regularly wash your hands. You should gargle as a prevention with salt in warm water. There’s no evidence this will prevent or cure the virus. Covid-19 starts with a sore throat lasting 3-4 days. It then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and the lungs, causing pneumonia, which takes about 5 or 6 days. With pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty breathing. The nasal congestion makes you feel like you’re drowning. This is a roughly accurate description of the most common symptoms, although not everyone with Covid-19 gets pneumonia. The symptoms may not come in this order or at these times. There have been no reports of sufferers experiencing nasal congestion that makes them feel they are drowning.

Italy disobeyed world health law from the WHO saying not to carry out autopsies on Covid-19 patients. The WHO never said autopsies couldn’t take place. Italy has found that Covid-19 is actually disseminated intravascular coagulation (thrombosis). The way to cure this is antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants. Antibiotics do not directly treat Covid-19, which is caused by a virus. The anti-inflammatory ibuprofen is being trialled for use against Covid-19 and an anticoagulant has been used in some Covid-19 cases. Aspirin is not a specific cure. Covid-19 is not a virus, but a bacterium being amplified by 5G which causes inflammation and hypoxia. Covid-19 patients can get secondary infections from bacteria. Hypoxia and types of inflammation can be symptoms of Covid-19. There’s no proof Covid-19 is in any way related to 5G. People with Covid-19 should take aspirin 100mg and Apronax or paracetamol. Trials into both of these drugs’ effectiveness in treating Covid-19 are ongoing, but haven’t concluded yet. Paracetamol can ease symptoms but isn’t a specific treatment. Covid-19 clots the blood causing thrombosis, stopping blood flow and oxygenating the heart and lungs. Severe Covid-19 can cause blood clotting problems and issues like this have been seen in Covid-19 patients, but this is not the only thing that can be fatal in patients. In a day, Italy sent home more than 14,000 patients after treating them with Aspirin and Apronax. The Italian Medicines Agency doesn’t mention aspirin or apronax in its list drugs used to treat Covid-19 outside of clinical trials. And there’s no record of a day when 14,000 people were sent home from hospital in Italy. There is an order to incinerate or immediately bury Covid-19 bodies without autopsy. There is no such order.

critics contended was too slow because the president initially failed to acknowledge the severity of the issue, social media users circulated a meme that supposedly documented a marked contradiction in the U.S. president’s statements on the issue across time:  According to this meme, as late as March 9, 2020, Donald Trump was still criticizing the press for supposedly “inflam[ing] the CoronaVirus situation” and quoting the U.S. surgeon general as asserting that, “The risk is low to the average American.” Yet a mere eight days later, according to the meme, Trump claimed he “felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.” However observers might choose to interpret them, both of these statements are accurately dated and attributed to Trump in the meme. Trump tweeted the first statement on March 9: The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, “The risk is low to the average American.” — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 9, 2020  The latter was a statement Trump made during a Coronavirus Task Force press briefing from the White House on March 17. As can be seen in the following video (at the 1:05:00 mark), as Trump fielded a question from a reporter about whether his “tone” on the pandemic had suddenly changed the previous day, he declared, “This is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. All you had to do is look at other countries; I think now it’s in almost 120 countries all over the world. No, I’ve always viewed it as very serious. There was no difference yesterday from days before”: The New York Times chronicled this statement from Trump and contrasted it with others he had made in the weeks leading up to it: For weeks, President Trump has minimized the coronavirus, mocked concern about it and treated the risk from it cavalierly. On [March 17] he took to the White House lectern and made a remarkable assertion: He knew it was a pandemic all along. “This is a pandemic,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.” This is what Mr. Trump has actually said over the past two months: On Jan. 22, asked by a CNBC reporter whether there were “worries about a pandemic,” the president replied: “No, not at all. We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n","In July 2015, a series of photographs purportedly showing a crow landing on and riding atop the back of an eagle in flight were a subject of social media fascination:   The photographs, which followed on the heels of similar animal ride-hitching images such as a weasel riding a woodpecker and a raccoon riding an alligator, left many viewers questioning their authenticity. Although some commenters disclaimed the above-displayed photographs as depicting an aerodynamically impossible activity, according to Kevin McGowan, a biologist who specializes in crow behavior, they are indeed real: “This would be kind of like a dog chasing a car and jumping up” on it, says McGowan. “Dogs always want to catch the car, but they never know what they’d do if they get it.” But why didn’t the eagle react to the crow landing? Since the crow wasn’t pecking, it didn’t warrant the Eagle’s attention. As the largest bird of prey, eagles are harassed nonstop by birds of all species. Sometimes the hecklers are so persistent, it looks like the eagles “are being followed by mosquitoes,” says McGowan. Phoo Chan, the bird photographer who snapped the photographs back in May 2014, offered a similar explanation on his 500px page: Crows are known for aggressively harassing other raptors that are much bigger in size when spotted in their territories and usually these ‘intruders’ simply retreat without much fuss. However, in this frame the crow did not seem to harass the bald eagle at such close proximity and neither did the bald eagle seem to mind the crow’s presence invading its personal space. What made it even more bizarre was that the crow even made a brief stop on the back of the eagle as if it was taking a free scenic ride and the eagle simply obliged. Chan’s photographs may seemingly depict an impossible (or at least one-in-a-million) scene, but other images of crows “riding” eagles abound online. In 2012, for example, Caters News photographer Hyeongchol Kim captured a similar occurrence in South Korea:   I saw the crow flying towards the much bigger eagle, and prepared myself to capture the fight on camera. However, the bird just hovered above the eagle for a few seconds – and then appeared to just latch onto his back. The eagle didn’t seem to mind at all — I think they must have been friends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n","More than 336,000 cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis were reported last year, as rates of all three STDs continued to increase across the state, the California Department of Public Health reported. Officials said they are particularly concerned by the number of congenital syphilis cases, which were 14% higher than the previous year and nearly 900% higher than in 2012. There were 22 stillbirths or neonatal deaths because of syphilis last year, the report said. If left untreated, syphilis can result in blindness, hearing loss and neurological problems. Chlamydia and gonorrhea can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy and chronic pelvic pain. Many STDs can be cured with antibiotics. The highest rates of STDs are among young people ages 15 to 24, officials said. The department’s acting director, Dr. Charity Dean, urged sexually active people to use condoms and get tested. “Regular testing and treatment are essential prevention strategies, even for people who have no symptoms,” Dean said in a statement. “Most people infected with an STD do not know it.” State officials are collaborating with local agencies to coordinate efforts to control STDs, the health department said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n","The study does not address costs. The method used to identify the new biomarkers is described as “a specialized technique developed at McMaster [University]” (where the research was done), making it difficult or impossible to estimate what the cost may be. The benefit here would appear to be that diagnostic testing for CF would be better able to identify infants who have CF, and possibly understand more about the expected course for individual patients — particularly patients with borderline results on the sweat chloride test currently used to diagnose CF in newborns. However, it’s not clear how common these cases are. Are there a lot of patients who have borderline sweat chloride tests? In addition, the release doesn’t tell us how much better the new biomarkers are at diagnosing CF. It suggests that the new tests add accuracy to the diagnosis — but by how much? The potential harms here involve errors in diagnosis. More specifically, the story does not address the specificity or sensitivity of the biomarker testing. And this is important. Specificity indicates how good a test is at ruling out people who don’t have a problem. Sensitivity addresses how good a test is at positively identifying people who actually have the problem. False positives can result in unnecessary treatments and costs. False negatives can result in patients not getting treatments that could help them. And if it’s still too early to tell what the specificity or sensitivity of the tests are, they need to address that. The release does not tell readers how many patients were involved in the study, making it impossible to tell how robust these findings are. In this case, the relevant journal article tells us that there were 50 infants who were not affected by CF and 18 that were affected by CF. For most conditions, this would be considered a very small sample size. It’s not clear whether consideration needs to be given to the fact that CF is a relatively uncommon disorder, making it more difficult to garner a larger sample size. The release would have been stronger if it had addressed this. No disease mongering here. The funding source is clearly marked and there does not appear to be a conflict of interest. However, it’s not clear whether the “specialized technique developed at McMaster” is being patented for use in the marketplace, or if it is being made freely available to other researchers. Either way, that would be a valuable point to make in the release. The release does a good job of explaining the sweat chloride test, which is widely used to make a final diagnosis of CF in infants and children. It is not clear how far these research findings are from making their way into clinical use. The story does a good job of explaining what is new here — researchers have found specific chemicals in the sweat of infants with CF that appear to be related to the disease. The release only stumbles when presenting what these findings mean or how they may be used in the context of clinical diagnosis and care. Here’s the news release headline: “Scientists discover biomarkers which could lead to better treatments for CF patients” (emphasis added). Treatments are mentioned only twice in the text of the release. Here, in the second paragraph: “The findings…shed new light on the underlying mechanisms of CF and could lead to improved prognosis and better therapies for a disease which is quite variable, affecting different children in different ways, say researchers.” And here, in the ninth paragraph: “The biomarkers also point to other underlying mechanisms that contribute to the progression of CF and could lead to better therapeutic interventions earlier in life.” In short, the release offers very little to support the idea of better treatments for CF patients. How does the study improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of CF? And how could that potentially lead to improved treatments? The release doesn’t tell us. One could see how it may lead to earlier treatment, if diagnoses are improved, but the release doesn’t address how earlier treatment could improve patient outcomes. So, while one can say that these biomarkers “could” lead to better treatments, one could just as easily say that these biomarkers “may not” lead to better treatments. The release would have been on much firmer ground if it had either fleshed out how the findings may inform future treatment research or had focused on the value of the study’s findings in regard to diagnostics.     1\n","\"Sen. Chris Dodd has been  widely panned  as the man responsible for allowing bailout recipient AIG to hand out huge bonuses, but it's really a  half truth  to say he's to blame. Dodd was actually the author of a provision that  limited  bonuses for AIG and other financial companies, though it's true that he later added a loophole that allowed some bonuses. Nevertheless, in the course of explaining his role in the matter, Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, committed one of this year’s most conspicuous flip-flops. As keepers of the Flip-O-Meter, we feel obligated to document it. Here’s what happened: As word of AIG’s bonuses filtered out, critics zeroed in on an amendment Congress passed in February that outlawed such bonuses but exempted contracts signed before Feb. 11, 2009. The amendment prohibited firms that had received federal bailout money from \"\"paying or accruing any bonus\"\" to the 25 most highly compensated employees as long as the company still owed the government money for the bailout. But somewhere in the legislative process, a line was added to say the amendment \"\"shall not be construed to prohibit any bonus payment required to be paid pursuant to a written employment contract executed on or before February 11, 2009.\"\" The extra line allowed AIG to hand out $165 million in bonuses for 2008 to executives of a division that lost piles of money that year. Dodd had authored the original amendment. So CNN asked him on March 18 whether he was the one who added the Feb. 11 effective date. \"\"There is the suggestion today being made that you received more money from AIG than any other senator, and that you were responsible for the February 11th, 2009, date,\"\" CNN producer Ted Barrett said to Dodd on March 18. \"\"So, just — you know, again, I just want to get at ...\"\" \"\"No,\"\" Dodd said. \"\"You're saying you had nothing to do with that date?\"\" Barrett pressed. \"\"Absolutely not,\"\" Dodd said. That was pretty clear. And yet a day later, with other sources telling CNN that Dodd was in fact the one who made the change, Dodd admitted as much. \"\"I agreed to a modification in the legislation, reluctantly,\"\" he told CNN's Dana Bash. \"\"I wasn't negotiating with myself here. I wasn't changing my own amendment. I was changing the amendment because others were insisting upon it.\"\" \"\"You were very adamant yesterday, very adamant that you didn't know how this change got in there,\"\" Bash said. \"\"And now you are saying that your staff did work with the administration?\"\" \"\"Going back and looking — obviously, I apologize,\"\" Dodd said. Treasury officials later confirmed they had asked Dodd to change the amendment because they were afraid executives would sue if it was retroactive. In a  press conference  , Dodd stressed that he was the one who authored the bonus restrictions in the first place, and that Treasury requested the change. \"\"I'm angry about it, and angry that in a sense I've been held up as sort of responsible for all this when in fact I responded to what I thought was a reasonable request at the time,\"\" Dodd said. \"\"I went through six weeks of a lot of criticism from the financial press, from Wall Street and others that my amendment was too restrictive, that it was unfair, that there would be a brain drain, that people would leave right and left.\"\" Still, it was Dodd who chose to insert the loophole. For his 180-degree switch from steadfast denier to contrite confessor.\"
